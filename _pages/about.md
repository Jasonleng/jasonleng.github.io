About me
======
I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Psychology at University of California, Berkeley. My research explores the the interaction between decision making, motivation, and cognitive control. I approach these questions through a combination of empirical experiments (e.g., fMRI, EEG, eye-tracking) and computational modelling (e.g., evidence accumulation, Bayesian inference, and optimization).

I obtained my PhD in cognitive science at Brown University. Before that, I completed my BS at Zhejiang Univeristy, China, and my MASc at Queen's University, Canada.
